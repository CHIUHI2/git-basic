What is the difference between "add", "commit", and "push"?

Ans : "Add", "commit" and "push" are Git commands that have different purposes in Git data transport process. For "add", the command adds files that have changes on the current local branch to the Git index, which is a staging area for objects prepared to be commited. For "commit", the command captures a snap of the staged changes and records it as a new revision with a log for the current local branch. For "push", the command finds out commits that presenting on the local branch but not the remote branch and uploads them to the respective branch on the remote repository. To commit our local changes to the remote repository, we can simply run these three commands with the sequecne "add", "commit" and "push".
